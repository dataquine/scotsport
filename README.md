# ScotSport - sports facilities in Scotland

## About app

[Sportscotland](https://sportscotland.org.uk/) - the national agency for sport
in Scotland has recorded the locations of sports facilities in Scotland and made
that data available as an 
[open data dataset](https://data.spatialhub.scot/dataset/sports_facilities-unknown). 
This app uses the data to show how many, where and what types of facility are 
available. This data has been processed and combined with other geographical and
population information. Users can see locations on a map or search a table of 
addresses. Some minor changes have been made to facilities information for 
presentation purposes and consistency. [1]

### Important

Please note that some of these facilities may be located on school/hotel grounds
or are run by private clubs. Not every facility listed will be easily 
accessible to the general public. Many will require payment or membership fees
to use. 

Accuracy of facilities information provided cannot be guaranteed so 
please do further research before planning a visit.

## Background

This started as a personal learning project for building my data 
cleaning/wrangling skills. Having previously worked in education I thought 
details of venues would be helpful for e.g. anyone working with young people or 
community groups looking for venues for different sports or health workers 
'social prescribing' activity to others for health reasons helping folk find 
places nearby. A public-facing website would be a convenient way of accessing 
this data so that's why I chose [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to publish a 
website version. There are several thousand facilties records. For ease of use 
these can be browsed by geographical council areas/towns or accessed via 
searchable tables. This app uses [R Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) to provide 
interactivity.

### Factoid

If you are Scottish and your first thought on seeing the word *'Scotsport'* 
was to think of a man in chequered sports jacket...then you are older than you 
look ðŸ˜Š

[Scotsport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotsport) also used to be the name 
of a much-loved sports show on STV in Scotland mostly covering football. For 
many of its earlier years hosted by the late, great 
[Arthur Montford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Montford). 

His jacket was **legendary**. 

Hear from [Arthur himself and see the faimed jaiket in black and white on YouTube](https://youtu.be/z3vt89S-ogs?si=p8rDxXLqeaVj8L3j&t=1175)
